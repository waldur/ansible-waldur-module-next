    """
    A declarative runner for standard Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) modules.

    This class is a concrete implementation of the `BaseRunner` and its primary
    responsibility is to translate the user's desired state into a "change plan".
    It achieves this by implementing the three abstract planning methods:
    `plan_creation`, `plan_update`, and `plan_deletion`.

    It does not contain any complex workflow logic (like `if/elif/else` blocks for
    state). All of that orchestration is handled by the universal `run()` method
    in the `BaseRunner`, making this implementation highly focused and readable.
