    Handles the execution logic for Ansible modules that manage resources via

    This runner is a hybrid:
    - For **updates and deletions**, it uses the standard, robust "plan-and-execute"
      workflow inherited from `BaseRunner`, leveraging the Command pattern for
      clean, predictive changes.
    - For **creation**, it implements a specialized, direct-execution workflow to
      handle the unique, multi-step process of submitting and polling a marketplace order.

    This design provides the best of both worlds: the structured power of the
    Command pattern for standard operations, and the necessary flexibility for the
    asynchronous creation process.

        Unlike simple CRUD, marketplace creation is an asynchronous, multi-step
        process that doesn't map cleanly to a single, atomic command. Therefore,
        this method deviates from the standard Command pattern for creation:

        - In **check mode**, it simply sets the `changed` flag and returns,
          signaling that a change is predicted.
        - In **execution mode**, it performs the entire create-and-wait logic
          directly and then returns an empty plan.

        while allowing updates and deletes to use the standard, elegant Command pattern.
